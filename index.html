        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <p>
          Yucatán is one of the three states that make up the Yucatán Peninsula.
          To the north is the Gulf of Mexico, which has provided lucrative trade
          with the United States, Europe and the Caribbean islands. The capital,
          Mérida, known as the white city, has a historic center dominated by
          Spanish colonial buildings, having been founded by Spanish
          conquistador Francisco de Montejo y León in 1542. The city was built
          to protect the Spaniards and Creoles from the revolts organized by the
          Maya Indians. In the late 19th century, Mérida began to prosper in the
          production of henequen and in the early 20th century it housed more
          millionaires than any other city in the world.

          Papadzules is a traditional Yucatán dish similar to Swiss enchiladas.
          They are boiled egg tacos covered with pepita sauce that has a green
          color and red tomato sauce. The pepita sauce is obtained by roasting
          the pumpkin seeds, then grinding them to form a kind of powder and
          finally boiling the powder in water with epazote. The tomato sauce is
          obtained by blending tomatoes with water and boiling the mixture with
          a little salt.
